.SH NAME
gitmount \- GNU Interactive Tools - auto-mount script
.SH SYNTAX
.I gitmount device

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gitmount
is a script which allows you to mount any block device without
specifying the file system type.  You may now insert the floppy in the
drive and type  '
.BR "gitmount fd0" '
and the first floppy will be mounted in the directory
.BR /mnt/fd0 .
On Linux just press
.B F11
or
.BR F12 .
You don't need to know the file system type anymore. The directories
.B /mnt/fd0
and
.B /mnt/fd1
are created if they don't exist.
