.SH NAME
gitwipe \- An utility for wiping files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gitwipe
.I  "file ..."

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B gitwipe
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.


\fBgitwipe\fP is an utility for wiping files.  It overwrites the file
contents with a random sequence of numbers and then calls `sync'().

.PP
Note that \fBgitwipe\fP does \fBnot\fP remove the wiped file since (under
`Linux' at least) the `sync'() system call might return before actually
writing the new file contents to disk.  Removing the file might be
dangerous because some file systems can detect that the blocks in the
removed wiped file are no longer used and never write them back to disk
in order to improve performance.  It is up to you to remove the file(s)
at a later moment.

.PP
.B gitwipe
is part of \fBgit\fP(1), the GNU Interactive Tools.

\fBgitwipe\fP and \fBgit\fP are documented fully by
.IR "GNU Interactive Tools" ,
available via the Info system.
