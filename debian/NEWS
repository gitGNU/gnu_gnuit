gnuit (4.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The package has been renamed to gnuit.
    The old git transitional package can be safely removed.

  * System copies of gitrc files in /usr/share/gnuit
    no longer have a leading dot. User copies in home directories
    should still have a "." at the start.

git (4.3.20-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * The /usr/bin/git transition is now complete, git longer provides
    /usr/bin/git. To run the GNU Interactive Tools filemanager, use
    the command 'gitfm'.

git (4.3.20-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * git, the filemanager with GNU Interactive Tools, is now called gitfm.

    This is to avoid conflicts with Linus Torvalds' content tracker,
    also called 'git'. Linus has refused to change the name of his
    git, so we are forced to change our name. The name gitfm has been
    chosen for consistency with the other git* tools (gitps, gitmount,
    gitrgrep, etc.).

    Until after etch, /usr/bin/git points to a transition script that
    warns the user and then runs gitfm.

    If you want to complete the transition early, install git-core
    then use 'update-alternatives --config git'

    Section names in the .gitrc.* config files have changed
    from [GIT-*] to [GITFM-*], however the old names are
    still accepted for backwards compatibility.

    These changes will also be in the next upstream version
    of GNU Interactive Tools.
